# MTLLayeredBuffer

A package encapsulating `MTLLayeredBuffer` from ARHeadsetKit. This type is not included in ARHeadsetUtil since it is distinct from the other utilities. For more about it, refer to [its article](https://github.com/philipturner/ARHeadsetKit/blob/main/docs/articles/layered-buffer.md) in the ARHeadsetKit article series.

> NOTE to self: switch the dependency from ARHeadsetUtil/temp to ARHeadsetUtil/main after validating that it works correctly
